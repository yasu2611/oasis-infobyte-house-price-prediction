🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression


📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on different features using a Linear Regression model.
The goal is to understand how property attributes (like area, bedrooms, location, etc.) influence the selling price and build a model that can accurately estimate house prices.

🎯 Objectives

Load and clean the dataset

Explore the data and understand feature relationships

Select important variables for prediction

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate model performance using error metrics

Visualize predictions vs actual values

🧹 1. Data Cleaning

Steps completed:

Handled missing values

Removed duplicate records

Fixed inconsistent data types

Checked for outliers

Normalized/encoded features if required

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed:

Descriptive statistics

Correlation analysis

Heatmaps

Distribution of target variable

Feature vs price relationship (scatter plots & bar charts)

🤖 3. Model Development
Feature Selection

Identified relevant features influencing price

Removed irrelevant or highly correlated features

Model Training

Used Scikit-Learn Linear Regression

Splitted data into training/testing sets

Model Evaluation

Used metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R-Squared Score (R²)

📈 4. Visualizations

Included:

Price distribution

Feature correlation heatmap

Actual vs Predicted price scatter plot

Residual plot

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📝 Key Insights

Certain features strongly influence house price (e.g., area, rooms, location)

Linear Regression gave a clear and interpretable model

Model performance was reasonably good (based on R² and error metrics)

The project demonstrates how ML can help estimate property prices# oasis-infobyte-house-price-prediction

✅ Conclusion

Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm for predicting house prices.


This project demonstrates the full pipeline: data cleaning → EDA → modeling → evaluation → visualization.
